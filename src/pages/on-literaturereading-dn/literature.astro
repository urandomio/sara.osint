NOWHERE TO HIDE is filled with real world case studies, specific resources and practical “how to” guides to equip both beginner and seasoned OSINT investigators with the right tools for their OSINT toolboxes.</p><p>This insightful volume includes 36 case studies that follow the FBI’s investigations of individual persons of interest, including the tactics, techniques, and procedures used by law enforcement, the media, and public sleuths to track down, identify, and – most importantly – verify the identities of suspected rioters. Learn how the FBI sifted through hundreds of thousands of leads, false positives, dead ends, as well as numerous unexpected leads to perform their investigations.</p><p>NOWHERE TO HIDE provides vivid context around the events of January 6, 2021, at the U.S. Capitol Building in Washington, DC, which left five people – one police officer and four protestors – dead by the end of the assault.</p><p>Effective OSINT research requires a combination of technical knowledge to find the Who, What, When, Where, and How threads of data and information as well as taking into account our unpredictable human nature that sometimes leads us to do the things we do (the Why). OSINT is both science and art. NOWEHERE TO HIDE provides practical, actionable information to help both novice and expert investigators, researchers, advocates, and journalists navigate and penetrate OSINT resources to find the information and evidence they seek.</p><p>Daniel Farber Huang is author of “Practical Cyber Security for Extremely Busy People” and a consultant to a wide range of organizations on cyber and strategy issues.
