    <h3>What is OSINT?</h3>
    <p>
      Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) is the collection, analysis, and use of publicly available data to generate actionable insights — all done legally and ethically. From social media posts to public records, satellite images to leaked databases, OSINT leverages the digital footprint of the modern world to uncover truth, solve problems, and support transparency.

    <h3>OSINT4GOOD</h3>
    <p>
      OSINT4GOOD is the movement to use open-source intelligence for ethical, humanitarian, and socially responsible purposes — like locating missing persons, exposing corruption, fighting disinformation, and protecting communities. It's about using digital sleuthing skills not for profit or harm, but for impact, accountability, and public good.
